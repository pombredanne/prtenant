PRtenant lives in your pull requests, and is *pertinent* to getting things
done.

It is a pull-request and code-review templater for git services and hosts.

Currently, it only supports GitHub. But there is no reason that that cannot
change.


Rationale
---------

If you submit a lot of pull requests on a daily basis with a standard comment
format, you want this extension. It auto-fills the pull request title and body
fields according to a format YOU specify to make your life easier.
